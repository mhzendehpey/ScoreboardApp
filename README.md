# ScoreboardApp
An Android Application Based on Firebase to Save and Monitor Your Game Results

Before you can build and start this app you need to setup your firebase services.
This app uses *Authentication* and *Realtime Database* services, so take care of these two in your console.

**Don't forget to:** 
- Place your *google-services.json* obtained from firebase console in app folder.

- Replace value of *rtdb_url* in string resources with your firebase realtime database url.
